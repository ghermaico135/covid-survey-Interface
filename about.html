                <h1>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria</h1>
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae. Antibiotics do not work against viruses.
                Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. In this case,
                antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider.
                There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. If you have symptoms, call your health care provider or
                COVID-19 hotline for assistance

                <h1>The prolonged use of medical masks* when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency</h1>
                <p>The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen
                deficiency. While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe
                normally. Do not re-use a disposable mask and always change it as soon as it gets damp.
                * Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are flat or pleated; they are affixed to the head with straps or have ear
                loops

                <h1>5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19
                </h1>
                <p>Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile
                networks.
                COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be
                infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose.

                </h1>
                <p>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature).
                They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare provider
                if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue.
